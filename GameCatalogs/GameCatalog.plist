		<string>Beat Saber is a unique VR rhythm game where your goal is to slash the beats (represented by small cubes) as they are coming at you. Every beat indicates which saber you need to use and also the direction you need to match. All the music is composed to perfectly fit the hand made levels. Our goal is to make players almost dance while cutting the cubes and avoiding obstacles. Each cut is strongly supported by great sound and visual effects to emphasize the rhythm.</string>

Magical Candy Kingdom is a fun candy shooting game for all ages! 

Once upon a time in a magical Candy kingdom, there was a king named King Candy and he had so many candies that his whole kingdom was enjoying them every day! 
On a glorious day, his army of candy cookies opened the door for a cute little fairy, who was lost and desperate to find a new place that she could call home. 

After hearing all the stories that the fairy was sharing with him, he felt that he needed to help her out. Without further thinking he offered the fairy to stay in his kingdom as long as she wanted and enjoy his candies.

At this point, he didn’t knew that the cute little fairy was actually a witch in disguise, wanting to take all his candy and his kingdom. 

The king was so interested in the fairy, that he invited her daily to his castle, to hear all the stories, which the fairy could tell him. </string>

A Chair in a Room: Greenwater is a tense Virtual Reality horror game set in America’s Deep South. Drawing on elements of Southern Gothic and using settings of derelict towns, run-down motels and murky, decaying swamps, A Chair in a Room will take you through an investigation of institutional corruption, religious immorality and murder, which can only be unlocked by searching deep within your own psyche. 

A calibration room will allow you get comfortable in VR but once you call the elevator, you begin your story as patient no. 6079 in The Greenwater Institute, with no recollection of who you are or what you did to be here. Dark visions bring your lucidity into question and only the doctor’s supply of medication can suppress those who wish to haunt you. 

Gameplay is a seamless weave of interaction and narrative that wraps exploration and tense horror in rich environmental storytelling to create something that is unique to VR. 

The story is broken down into six chapters of around 20 to 30 minutes in length to allow for intervals in play while enjoying the story.</string>

		<string>Fancy Skiing is developed by HashVR Studio built with the Unity Engine.The game&apos;s structure is based on real skiing that players use the handles just as ski poles to get power and lean left or right to control the direction, which brings players a strong immersion. Furthermore, we add a lot of fancy elements, like leaping grand canyons and hunting deer. While 
skiing, players try their best to avoid obstacles including dynamic ones to ski as far as they can and speed also plays an import role in your final score.
You can sit down to play the game if you feel a bit sick.</string>

		<string>GORN is a ludicrously violent VR gladiator simulator, made by Free Lives, the developers of Broforce and Genital Jousting. Featuring a unique, fully physics driven combat engine, GORN combatants will be able to creatively execute their most violent gladiatorial fantasies in virtual reality. Savagely strike down an infinite supply of poorly-animated opponents with all manner of weapons – from swords, maces, and bows to nunchuks, throwing knives, massive two-handed warhammers or even your blood-soaked bare hands. The only limits to the carnage are your imagination and decency, in the most brutal and savage VR face-smashing game ever produced by man.</string>

		<string>In Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes, one player is trapped in a room with a ticking time bomb they must defuse. The other players are the “Experts” who must give the instructions to defuse the bomb by deciphering the information found in the Bomb Defusal Manual. But there’s a catch: the Experts can’t see the bomb, so everyone will need to talk it out – fast!

Rounds are fast-paced, tense, occasionally silly, and almost always loud. Everybody has a role to play whether they are defusing the bomb or deciphering information from the manual. 

Puzzle solving and communication skills – and maybe a few friendships – will be put to the test as players race to defuse bombs while communicating quickly, clearly, and effectively.</string>

		<string>Try your hand at the VR spaceflight challenge reviewers have dubbed “not a hurl fest!” Enter a world full of immersive alien landscapes through which you must navigate at high speeds, using lightning-fast reflexes to score points and earn your rep as the ultimate starfighter pilot. How long can you survive? 

PolyRunner VR is an addictive, high-quality experience that tests your skills against an other-worldly, ever-changing landscape rather than testing your ability to maintain control of your stomach. This engaging virtual world offers more interesting, challenging terrain the further you progress. All the while, you can collect bonus points for your precision by navigating through checkpoints and utilizing boosts to give you an extra edge. The intuitive controls make it easy for anyone to compete in this spaceship runner, but mastering flight skills is a feat that will earn you a place among the top guns and make you worthy of a personal theme song that would inspire jealousy in any maverick pilot. Will you accept the challenge?</string>

		<string>Hi, we are the developers of &quot;Deadly Hunter VR&quot; an Archery Game we released earlier this year. It&apos;s free and very positive, so be sure to check it out. 

With &quot;Deadly Hunter VR&quot; we gained a deep insight into VR development. We learned a lot while making it and we want to use our skills in our next project:
The Ranger: Lost Tribe

It is an Action RPG with focus on real time fights and exploring. Now the content of the game is just part of the full version, but it offers over four (4) hours’ worth of glorious gaming experience and will give you a good challenge.

You will start at the Base Camp were you can play around with Sword, Crossbow, Bow, Shield and Spear. Once you leave the Camp you will only have your Sword and your Shild and it is up to you to find the other ones.

Besides of the standard sword fighting mechanism we also included stealth kills and dismemberment. On top of it you can also enchant your weapon with your found recources. We also support different locomotion styles.

We basically opened up for you a big area for you to explore. You may stumble across some things that you can&apos;t use yet because they belong to the story we have planned.

You can help to make &quot;The Ranger: Lost Tribes&quot; an awesome game. Simply download our demo an play it. Write us what you think about it in the discussions. Any suggestions, freature requests and feedback in general is very valuble to us in this current state.

Key features: 
- huge environment for you to explore
- save feature (checkpoints)
- you decide how you approach the enemys
- different weapons
- stealth kills
- dismemberment
- different locomotion options
- enchant feature</string>

		<string>Neo-Shinjuku - 2271. The massive and seemingly benevolent Eden Corporation owns the world. The elite hacker resistance movement SyndiK8 has unearthed the sinister reality behind Eden Corp’s newest line of robotic products. As one of SyndiK8’s elite operatives, your mission is straightforward: infiltrate Eden Tower, steal as much Raw Data as possible, and get out alive--bringing Eden Corp down in your wake. 

However, as the secrets behind Chairman Shiro’s new “Promotion” program becomes clear, the reality gets much more complicated. Does it really grant immortality? What is Eden truly collecting? It seems that Eden’s corporate veneer may be just a thin facade for something much, much worse.

Built from the ground up for virtual reality, Raw Data’s action combat gameplay, intuitive controls, challenging enemies, and sci-fi atmosphere will completely immerse you within the surreal environments of Eden Corp. Go solo—or team up with a friend—and become the adrenaline-charged heroes of your own futuristic technothriller. You will put your wits, boldness, and endurance to the test.

Active VR gameplay turns you into a controller, with instant reflex access to an arsenal of advanced weapons and cutting-edge nanotech powers. Shared spaces with avatars and motion tracking encourage players to physically communicate through body language and environment interaction.</string>

		<string>The OASIS beta is inspired by the immersive virtual universe the OASIS from the film Ready Player One, which is set in the year 2045. In the Oasis beta’s ever-expanding universe, players are able to explore, compete in, and launch multiple VR experiences using their own custom avatars. Global leaderboards track the performance of all players as they earn points (coins) throughout the following experiences: Rise of the Gunters, Battle for the OASIS, Gauntlet and Smash.

Gauntlet - Navigate through a seemingly endless dungeon while the undead seek to destroy you. Collecting gold will improve your score and eating food will restore your health, but only your bow skills will ensure that you make it our alive. (Developed by Directive Games)
Battle for the OASIS - Help to save the OASIS by defeating waves of IOI Sixers. Advance through the trenches of Planet Doom towards the snowy planes that surround Anorak’s Castle. With an arsenal of potent firepower, you must stop the Sixers from controlling the fate of the OASIS. (Developed by Steel Wool Studios)
Rise of the Gunters - Fight against a nearly invincible army of highly trained IOI Sixers alone OR with up to two of your friends! Proceed with caution as you defeat Sixers, collect their coins, find power ups and survive a merciless onslaught of hyper-explosive kinetic action for as long as you can survive. The OASIS is yours. Take it back from IOI by yourself or with up to two fellow Gunters! (Developed by Drifter Entertainment Inc.)
Smash - Enhance your hand and eye coordination in this nod to James Halliday’s favorite 80&apos;s arcade games.
Fracture - Heighten your spatial awareness and reflexes in this throwback to 80&apos;s brick smasher games re-imagined in VR.</string>

		<string>ERADICATE MACHINES. SAVE EARTH.
Jump into the middle of the action in Regenesis Arcade Lite, the VR sci-fi shooter set in dystopian future ran by machines. Select one of two locomotion modes (free movement or teleport) and choose from variety of weapons, one for each hand, creating powerful synergies using perks to take the fight to machines.

Most of game’s content will be a bit different every time you play due to a random generation mechanism.

WEAPONS &amp; UPGRADES: INSTRUMENTS OF DESTRUCTION
Collect weapons from each of three categories, that can be upgraded for maximized firepower. From gravity gun, through minigun, shotgun to powerful rocket launcher and wavegun, every weapon comes with its own strengths and weaknesses you need to consider while in the heat of the combat.

KNOW YOUR ENEMY
Fighting the deadly killing machines will not be easy. Coming from all directions, covering both ground and air, each enemy requires different tactical approach. Some will activate shields that either deflect or absorb damage, others will dodge swiftly every shot coming at them or make a kamikaze run right into your face. Do not underestimate your opponent no matter how small it might be!

THE WAR THEATER
In Regenesis Arcade Lite, you will battle through 8 detailed maps in campaign mode (Lite version allow to play first map only), ranging from futuristic cities, through forests to atomic wastelands, in different weather conditions, including a snowy blizzard!

Discover and explore each map’s enemies and weapons drops in order to gain tactical advantage! After you finish the campaign you will continue in game+ mode, that will increase the difficulty and enable all types of enemies and unique weapons to be spawned in each level.

After you unlock a level, you can start campaign from any point you want, getting faster to the further part of the game but not having all the goodies you might have collected if you’d start from the beginning. It’s up to you to either save your time grinding or prepare yourself better for the onslaught!
However, as the secrets behind Chairman Shiro’s new “Promotion” program becomes clear, the reality gets much more complicated. Does it really grant immortality? What is Eden truly collecting? It seems that Eden’s corporate veneer may be just a thin facade for something much, much worse.

Built from the ground up for virtual reality, Raw Data’s action combat gameplay, intuitive controls, challenging enemies, and sci-fi atmosphere will completely immerse you within the surreal environments of Eden Corp. Go solo—or team up with a friend—and become the adrenaline-charged heroes of your own futuristic technothriller. You will put your wits, boldness, and endurance to the test.

		<string>#SelfieTennis is much more than a tennis game with a really nice physics simulation and great AI, accessible to players of ALL ages and with ZERO motion sickness. 

You play against yourself on a tennis court in the clouds, with Ball People surrounding you and messing around together with you. Their AI can be described as highly sophisticated, funny, stupid, and other things. 

For hardcore tennis fans, we made the best physics system that we could, and tennis pros have confirmed that it is indeed a pretty good simulation, but without all the hassles of real life, such as running after the balls or not shooting at other people. 

For people who enjoy playing in their own rhythm and not following rules, the game has a perfect mix of funky sandboxy upgrades such as: #lightsaber, #violins, #selfies, #bow and #arrows for that #archery mood, #ponycorn to let you move around on horseback (stick), and #hearts to break (to get more upgrades). 

We now support the HTC Racket tracker peripheral! Start the game with it activated and you can play two-handed (or dual-wield rackets) for an intense workout - the Ball People will take care of your balls, you just have to spank them!

Instructions
You use the triggers to spawn the ball(s) and racket. Double-click on racket trigger to lock it. You can change controller hands on the small button above the touchpad. Knock #BallPeople off the court and take their hearts to enter #HeartAttack mode (time-limited upgrades).

#SelfieStick is on ball controller&apos;s grips and you can record a GIF and tweet it out via the touchpad - log on to your Twitter profile via the computer screen when you start the game. Double-click grips to lock it in your hand. SAFETY IS KING: Controllers can fly, SO WEAR WRIST STRAPS! </string>

		<string>Вы когда-нибудь задумывались о том, каково быть в шкуре Крутого Сэма? Вы когда-нибудь хотели отвесить люлей прихвостням Ментала собственными руками? Что же, время пришло! Возьмите на себя роль величайшего героя Армии Обороны Земли в уникальной VR-симуляции, основанной на журнальных записях Сэма Стоуна в бытность его службы капитаном боевого эсминца &quot;&quot;Саратога&quot;&quot;. Пройдите через тот ад, который сделал капитана Стоуна легендой.
Ключевые особенности:
Тонны врагов – Орды атакующих врагов всегда были визитной карточкой серии, и Serious Sam: The Last Hope по-прежнему позволяет устраивать на экране настоящее безумие, благодаря серьезной мощи движка Serious Engine 2017. 
Тонны оружия – Спаренные миниганы, автоматы Томпсона, тяжелые лазерные пушки, дробовики, и целый ассортимент других стволов. Ах, да, еще и с бензопилой впридачу! Используйте целых 16 различных видов оружия, включая ракетницу, ну и самую главную игрушку Сэма для отстрела нечисти - миниган. А для приличия - меч и щит.
Скачки по планетам – Посетите пять уникальных планет, и сразитесь посреди коварных египетских песков, впотьмах под древними руинами или на поверхности Пладеона, давно заброшенного сердца великой индустриальной цивилизации.
Дик тоже вернулся! - Неизменный голос Крутого Сэма, Джон Джей Дик, сыплет своими колкими шутками так же быстро, как вы изничтожаете врагов.
Поплачьтесь своей Мумичке – Уничтожьте могущественных слуг Ментала, включая Нечестивую Космическую Мумию из Гаммы Пегаса, громадную бессмертную тварь, возрожденную с помощью темной магии - опасную настолько же, насколько и вонючую! И это лишь первый босс, коих всего пять - каждый из них смертоноснее и ужаснее предыдущих.
Совершенствуйтесь - Улучшайте себя и свой арсенал с помощью 36 бонусов и 190 оружейных улучшений, открываемых во время похождений Сэма.
Танцуйте вдвоем - Проходите уровни с другом, выбирая между Крутым Сэмом или Крутышкой Сэмми в качестве игрового персонажа.
Случайно генерируемый геймплей! - Эта новая игровая опция разделена на три различных режима. Уничтожайте орды случайных врагов с уникальным составом при каждой новой игре в безбашенном режиме Арена. Сражайтесь с бесконечными ордами врагов, оставаясь в живых как можно дольше в режиме Бесконечная волна, или поставьте свое мягкое место на кон в Ежедневных испытаниях, проходя на арене дня те же испытания, что и другие игроки по всему миру.</string>

		<string>Remember those awesome classic arcade cabinets? Imagine if those were immersive... Space Pirate Trainer puts you in one of those; fighting off relentless waves of droids with all the weapons and gadgets you would ever need as a space pirate. You better dodge some of those incoming lasers though, since just using your shields won&apos;t get you in the top rankings. Pick up your blasters, put on your sneakers, and dance your way into the Space Pirate Trainer hall of fame.

Space Pirate Trainer is the official trainer for wannabe space pirates in VR. Launched as one of the first titles for SteamVR/HTC Vive, Oculus Touch and Windows Mixed Reality, Space Pirate Trainer has been under continuous development on a mission to refine its gameplay and improve the overall experience. It has been widely used as one of the go-to demos for VR.

No real droids where harmed during the creation of this game. 
Use your straps and stay in your VR area to make sure no humans will be harmed.</string>

		<string>theBlu: is a deeply immersive VR series that allows audiences to experience the wonder and majesty of the ocean through different habitats and come face to face with some of the most awe inspiring species on the planet. The series, which is directed by Jake Rowell (Call of Duty, Final Fantasy, Superman Returns), has been designed as beautiful moments in passing or a collection of memories that powerfully tap into the vast potential of VR. The debut episode, featuring an incredible close encounter with an 80 foot whale, is already recognized as one the most iconic room scale VR experiences to date (a Sundance Film Festival 2016 selection). Additional episodes in this bundle take place on a teeming coral reef and in the very deepest region of the ocean. Gain access to new modes of discovery in each episode. Slow time and capture pictures in Inspector Mode, and return to a meditative version of each location in Ambient Mode.</string>

		<string>Room scale: The game is currently room scale only with a minimum space requirement of 2m front-to-back. If playing with SteamVR, please make sure you have gone through setup in &quot;room scale&quot; mode.

Oculus Rift users: Native Oculus support is included. Please ensure your Guardian boundaries are configured properly. For best results, you&apos;ll need 2m of front-to-back space.

Windows MR users: The Thrill of the Fight is compatible with WMR headsets and controllers, but holding your controllers near your face to block causes tracking loss due to the way WMR controllers are tracked. Because of this, I have not marked support for Windows Mixed Reality on the store page. If you still wish to play, please make sure you have configured your headset properly for room scale and have 2m of space front-to-back.

The Thrill of the Fight is still under active development. Future improvements include more polish, new opponents, and more.

The Thrill of the Fight is a boxing game designed specifically for VR. Enter a virtual gym and battle unique challengers with their own boxing styles and techniques. Use timing and skill to land the knockout blow. Evade punches, land jabs, and block blows to become the king of the ring.

The Thrill of the Fight is best described as a &quot;semi-sim&quot; with some simplified or unrealistic mechanics for the sake of fun and straightforward game play or to accommodate the limits of current VR technology. Mechanics are realistic where possible but the game is not guaranteed to be a fully accurate recreation of real boxing.</string>

		<string>Vanishing Realms: Rite of Steel is an immersive Role Playing Game designed from the ground up for Virtual Reality play. Use one-to-one motion controls and movement so that you are fully in control of combat. To swing, duck and block, you don&apos;t hit a button, but physically move to perform these actions as if you were there - because you are! 

Treasure chests, weapon shops, a horde of undead foes, mystic writings, banished gods, lost artifacts, ancient tombs and moonlit forest - it&apos;s all here waiting to be discovered in a beautifully hand-crafted VR realm. 

Battle life-sized monsters in stunning, face-to-face melee and magical combat. Hold weapons directly in your hands, learn to block enemy strikes, seek openings in their armor and defenses and strike back. The longer you play Vanishing Realms, the more you&apos;ll hone your physical skills. You&apos;ll take on more powerful and advanced enemies as you move deeper into the world.
Explore, Discover, Collect, Solve, Play. Directly interact and move freely through a rich and varied fantasy world. Vanishing Realms combines the long tradition of hand-crafted game design with the intuitive and immersive experiences made possible through Virtual Reality and hand-held tracked controllers. 
Surround yourself with Adventure. Pause to take in the moonlit vista before you. Rest beneath a gnarled apple tree - it&apos;s good to see the night sky again. How long have you been fighting and exploring in this place? Rummage in your backpack, take a few bites of bread and cheese, drink a healing draught, think of all you&apos;ve seen and...is something moving over there...on the tree line, beyond the rock outcropping?</string>

		<string>Welcome to The VR Museum of Fine Art, Steam&apos;s finest art gallery.

Depending on who you ask, of course.

If you&apos;ve been training to be a space pirate and building fantastical contraptions all day, the Museum is your ticket to a well-deserved break. Surround yourself with 1:1 scale sculptures and paintings, and we won&apos;t tell anybody if you touch the merchandise! No rope barriers or glass walls here. Feel free to explore the artwork however you see fit. Roomscale VR lets you walk around, duck under, and even hug the life-sized figures.

The initial release of The VR Museum includes 15 high-fidelity sculptures, and more are coming. In addition, two famous paintings are included, scanned and rendered in crisp detail. In future releases, both collections of sculpture and paintings are sure to expand. The artwork is arranged thoughtfully into four exhibits, each with its own theme. 

If you ever actually feel like learning something, informative holographic plaques are placed next to each piece of art. That does involve reading, though, and that&apos;s a lot of work.

Tickets are free, drinks are temporarily non-existent, and the artwork is pristine. Enjoy!</string>

		<string>Wacky Moles is VR casual game like the Whack-A-Mole. The legend of this town continues and more moles from the backyard also get involved in….
The storyline of this game is that naughty moles often wander in the vegetable field of the backyard. In order to protect vegetables and fruits we laboriously planted, we have to raise up our hammer to fight against these naughty moles.

How to Play:
In the game, players attack all kinds of moles with the hammer. The player should eliminate moles as many as possible within a specific limited time, so as to obtain scores. Of course, don’t accidentally injure kind-hearted rabbits if you meet them. This is can not only make you lose HP, but also miss the chance to get gifts from them. Some moles will not allow themselves to be seized without putting up a fight. They will throw out all kinds of items to attack players. The player can move to avoid their attacks or block attacks with the hammer.
There are a lot of props in the game. Players can pick up these props by hammer attack. Freezing props can freeze all objects, making the player easier to hit the target. Twinkling stars have full screen AoE skill. Once triggered, they can cause a lot of damage on moles within the scene. Watch out flying saucer props. Don’t carelessly pick up them, because they can turn your hammer into a smaller one to increase the game difficulty. Of course, there are also many other interesting props waiting for you to explore one by one!
Game Features:
Mini and Exaggerated Character Settings
Rich Mole Varieties: ordinary mole, party mole, pilot mole and cowboy mole
Immersive Experience that redefines Whack-A-Mole
Rich Featured Gameplays such as gifts, props, dodge and block</string>

“If we were meant to stay in one place, we would have roots rather than feet!”

My friend Damia recently went on a trip around the world. She started in Australia and went around China, Nepal, India, South Korea, Indonesia and few other countries.

She learned about people&apos;s struggles, experienced life with the locals and learned about their culture. Seeing her Facebook posts inspired me. I was pumped to do the same!

The only problem was that all I had was 100 bucks in my bank account and a Vive.
That’s why I decided to build an app which would let me travel in VR.

Presenting Travel VR, the best way to travel.

Bon voyage!

Gameplay
- Try moving your head around to highlight different countries.
- To spin the earth, hold down the trigger on your right hand and move it. 
- To make the earth bigger, press down the grip button on both controllers and spread your hands apart.
- Look at the country you want to travel to. When the country is highlighted, press the left touchpad to travel.</string>
